### Components Not Removed (But Not Used):

These components still exist but are not imported or used anywhere:
- `/components/LocaleSelector.tsx` - Not imported in any component
- `/components/PriceDisplay.tsx` - Not imported in any component
- `/contexts/LocaleContext.tsx` - Context file exists but not used

**Note**: These files can be deleted if desired, but they're harmless since they're not imported anywhere.

## Error Fixed

### Before:
```
Error: useLocale must be used within a LocaleProvider
    at useLocale (contexts/LocaleContext.tsx:114:10)
    at HomePage (components/HomePage.tsx:156:16)
```

### After:
✅ No errors - all `useLocale` calls removed from components
✅ No `LocaleProvider` wrapper needed
✅ Application runs without locale context

### ✅ What's Removed:

- LocaleSelector component
- Region-based auto-detection
- Price conversion system

### ✅ What's Added:

## Optional Cleanup

If you want to completely remove the locale files:

```bash
# These files can be safely deleted:
rm components/LocaleSelector.tsx
rm components/PriceDisplay.tsx
rm contexts/LocaleContext.tsx
rm utils/i18n.ts (optional - still used by CareersPage)
rm utils/regionDetection.ts
```

**Note**: Keep `/utils/i18n.ts` for now since CareersPage still uses it for translations.

✅ **Website now simpler and faster**
✅ **Client Portal button added to header**
